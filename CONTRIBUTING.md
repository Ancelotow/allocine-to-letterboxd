## 🪾 Branches

The project is small, so all Pull Requests should be made directly to the main branch.
We do not use multiple branches for this project.

## ✉️ Commit Guidelines

We use **Conventional Commits** to make the commit history readable.  
Each commit should be clear and describe **what it does**, not just “update” or “fix”.

## 🌿 Pull Requests (PR)
- All PRs should be made directly on the main branch.
- This project is small, no need to create multiple branches.
- Each PR should have a clear title and describe the main change.
- Include examples if necessary (e.g., how to use a new function).
- Make sure the code compiles and works before submitting.

## ⚠️ Important Points
- Do not include tokens or secrets in commits/PRs.
- Follow the commit convention to maintain a clean history.
- PRs should improve the project or fix a bug. No spam or unnecessary changes.
